## Background

In indonesia where large portion of people are still unbanked and credit card penetration is very low. Subscribtion based business model cannot be flourished. Let alone any social non profit organization who lived from donation.

There are countless of organization, activity, or even creator who can be helped its sustainability by enabling such subscribtion model. Greenpeace has been doing it for years in indonesia, asking donation in the street targetting people who already have credit cards to support their sustainability by monthly donation.

## Competitor landscape

Kitabisa is a social donation platform adopting kickstarter model. It geard toward campaign, one-time-off based model. While we really appreciate its existence its hard to imagine it will shift into subscibtion model.

Patreon model is more suitable, however due to low credit card prenetation and large portion of indonesian who not familiar with english make it harder to be relied on to solved such issues.

## Backer.id value proposition

In the core, Backer.id try to solved the same area. However it have a lot of slight variance in it's implementation. Backer.id is prioritised to be geared toward social non profit organization to gather support, publish update, manage their backer.

In the meantime, its also designed to be scalable in helping other are which can be solved using exact same donation based feature.
